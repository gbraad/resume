# Employment History

## Senior Software Engineer
  * InfThink (Beijing), September 2015 - present

    Product development as hired coonsultant dealing with IoT/WoT and HTML5-enabled operating systems.
    
    Currently I deal with developing a WoT platform based on Android/FirefoxOS utilizing ideas and techniques used in Platform-as-a-Service. As part of this I wrote a system process which listens to incoming requests to spawn on-device processes for interaction with the front-end code they serve. The backend process can interact with the hardware and other on-device services.
    

## Senior Full-stack Engineer
  * [ThoughtWorks][employer tw] (Beijing), November 2013 - September 2015

    Developed the backend and associated front-end code of both desktop and mobile platforms for Fortune 500 companies. A combination of technologies were employed to allow easy integration, such as RESTful API, sending data back-and-forth as JSON. Front-end code I wrote used Angular or React. Where possible it employed HTML5 technology to improve the user-experience. Other activities I involved in was the deployment and maintenance practices of the aformentioned applications.
    
    Since most of the code involved with Personal Identifying Information I focussed for a part of my work on security problems. Because of my work, these applications passed scans of internal security teams and SensePost. For this OWASP security guidelines were used. To aid in finding potential issues a combination of techniques was employed, such as using static code analysis using Fortify and actively scanning applications in use using Zed Attack Proxy. To prevent future recurrences of fixed issues and prevent occurences of similar issues automated regression testing
    
    As part of business development I set up an Embedded and Hardware Lab. One of the projects I made used FirefoxOS to show-off the potential to use this platform for IoT. For hardware access the front-end code would communicate to a Node process running on the device.

    Technology used: .NET, Windows, HTML5 & Friends, JavaScript (Angular, ReactJS, JQuery, Grunt, gulp, Karma, CucumberJS), SAML, WS-Fderation, Go Continuous Delivery, Linux (Fedora, debian), Virtualization (KVM), ruby (cucumber) and python (locust)
